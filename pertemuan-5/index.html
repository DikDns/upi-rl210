        <p class="in-view-appear">
          Gold Roger was known as the Pirate King, the strongest and most
          infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and death of
          Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world.
          His last words before his death revealed the location of the greatest
          treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought
          about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece
          (which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame), and quite
          possibly the most coveted of titles for the person who found it, the
          title of the Pirate King.

        <p class="in-view-appear">
          Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your standard
          definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked,
          hardened, toothless pirate who ransacks villages for fun, Luffy's
          reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder; the thought of an
          exciting adventure and meeting new and intriguing people, along with
          finding One Piece, are his reasons of becoming a pirate. Following in
          the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across
          the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark
          mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One
          Piece.
